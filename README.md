# LOUISITE
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/b5ed574c-98f0-4d7e-bec5-ebcf23f65039/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/louisite/deploys)

**LOUISITE** (stylized as LOUI**SITE**, portmanteau of *Louis* and *site*) is my personal website—this is the second iteration—showcasing my accomplishments. This website was built with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

The second iteration was designed with a much simpler and all-new layout to emphasize my works over any other things. Choosing to do multi-page website was a great option to prevent things from bloating the single index page, like what I regrettably did in the [first iteration](https://github.com/itslouisgs/louisite-v1).
