# Hey, it's Louis "itslouisgs"â€”a software engineer based in Indonesia.
I enjoy coding for things on the Internet and exploring new programming languages, libraries, and frameworks. My obsession with modifying my [Fandom](https://www.fandom.com/) profile page's theme with HTML and CSS sparked my interest in web development.

I'm currently a third-year **computer science undergraduate** at [BINUS University](https://binus.ac.id/) and **Manager of Web Development Division** of [HIMTI BINUS University](https://himti.or.id/). During my time as Manager of Manager of Web Development Division, I gained a lot of knowledge about project management and the software development process. On top of that, I was granted the Mentoring Scholarship Program at BINUS University for having a GPA of over 3.5, provided that I conduct peer-to-peer learning sessions for other students.

## Skills
Here are some technologies that I am familiar with:
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- TypeScript 
- React 
- Tailwind CSS 
- Bootstrap 
- PHP 
- Laravel 
- C/C++ 
- Java 
- Python 
- SQL 
- MySQL 
- Git
