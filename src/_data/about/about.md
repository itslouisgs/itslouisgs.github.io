# Hey, it's Louis "leejhlouis"—a software engineer based in Indonesia.

I find joy in coding and exploring programming languages, libraries, and frameworks. My obsession with modifying my [Fandom](https://www.fandom.com/) profile page's theme with HTML and CSS sparked my interest in software engineering.

I'm currently a **penultimate computer science undergraduate** at [BINUS University](https://binus.ac.id/). Additionally, I'm also interning as a Software Development Engineer at [Blibli.com](https://blibli.com)—a pioneering e-commerce giant in Indonesia. This internship is part of BINUS University's specialized final-year enrichment program, where students are required to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios.

Previously, I assumed the role of **Manager of Web Development Division** of [HIMTI BINUS University](https://himti.or.id/), a computer science student association at BINUS University. Furthermore, I received the Mentoring Scholarship Program at BINUS University for three consecutive semesters, an honor granted to students mantaining a GPA above 3.5 while actively conducting peer-to-peer learning sessions for peers.
